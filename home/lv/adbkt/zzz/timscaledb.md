## Slide 1: **TimescaleDB: Scalable SQL for Time-Series Data**

- Open-source time-series database
- Built as a PostgreSQL extension
- Combines relational reliability with time-series performance

---

## Slide 2: **Origins \& Motivation**

- Launched in 2018
- Responds to the need for efficient time-series data handling
- Maintains SQL compatibility for ease of adoption

---

## Slide 3: **Core Architecture**

- **Hypertables:** Virtual tables partitioned for scalability
- **Chunks:** Underlying physical partitions by time (and optionally space)
- Transparent to users-standard SQL interface

---

## Slide 4: **Partitioning Strategy**

- Partitions by time interval and optional space key (e.g., device ID)
- Optimizes both write and read operations
- Enables efficient data retention and query performance

---

## Slide 5: **Key Features**

- Full SQL support (PostgreSQL ecosystem)
- Advanced compression for storage efficiency
- Continuous aggregates for real-time analytics
- Distributed hypertables for horizontal scaling

---

## Slide 6: **Performance Optimizations**

- SIMD vectorization for fast analytics
- Dense indexes for columnstore (hypercore)
- Efficient refresh of continuous aggregates
- Recent releases focus on analytical query speed

---

## Slide 7: **Distributed Architecture**

- Access nodes \& data nodes for scaling out
- Elastic scaling-no redistribution of existing data
- Partitioning adapts as new nodes are added

---

## Slide 8: **Recent Developments**

- Low-downtime live migrations (production-ready)
- Timescale Cloud: AWS Transit Gateway, CSV import, replica metrics
- Enhanced MySQL import and UI chunk management

---

## Slide 9: **Key Use Cases**

- **IoT:** Handles high-volume, multi-device data
- **Monitoring:** DevOps metrics, logs, and traces
- **Finance:** Trading, risk management, analytics
- **Machine Learning:** Stores and aggregates training data

---

## Slide 10: **Implementation Considerations**

- Flexible data modeling: wide-table or narrow-table
- Partitioning strategy critical for scaling
- Integrates seamlessly with BI and analytics tools

---

## Slide 11: **Conclusion**

- Combines SQL familiarity with time-series power
- Robust, scalable, and actively developed
- Ideal for organizations needing high-performance time-series analytics

---

## Slide 12: **Learn More**

- [timescale.com](https://www.timescale.com)
- Documentation, tutorials, and open-source community
