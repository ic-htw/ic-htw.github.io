# RFM Customer Segmentation Analysis - KPI Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of all Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) calculated in the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) customer segmentation SQL query. The query uses a multi-CTE approach to segment customers into actionable marketing groups with specific recommendations.

---

# KPI 1: FirstPurchaseDate

## Definition
**FirstPurchaseDate** represents the date of a customer's first purchase transaction. This marks the beginning of the customer relationship and is used for cohort analysis and customer age calculations.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
MIN(fis.OrderDate) AS FirstPurchaseDate
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{FirstPurchaseDate} = \min_{i}(\text{OrderDate}_i)$$

where $i$ ranges over all orders for the customer.

**Business Purpose:** Establishes the customer's entry point into the business ecosystem, enabling age-based analysis and cohort tracking.

## Examples
- Customer A: First purchase on 2019-01-15 (5-year customer if analyzed in 2024)
- Customer B: First purchase on 2023-11-20 (new customer, <2 years old)
- Customer C: First purchase on 2015-06-10 (veteran customer, 9+ years)

---

# KPI 2: LastPurchaseDate

## Definition
**LastPurchaseDate** represents the date of a customer's most recent purchase. This is the foundation for recency analysis in RFM segmentation.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
MAX(fis.OrderDate) AS LastPurchaseDate
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{LastPurchaseDate} = \max_{i}(\text{OrderDate}_i)$$

**Business Purpose:** Critical for determining customer activity status and identifying at-risk or churned customers.

## Examples
- Customer A: Last purchase 2024-12-15 (active, recent)
- Customer B: Last purchase 2023-06-20 (18 months ago, at risk)
- Customer C: Last purchase 2021-03-10 (dormant/churned)

---

# KPI 3: TotalOrders

## Definition
**TotalOrders** counts the number of distinct purchase orders a customer has placed. This is the foundation for the Frequency dimension in RFM analysis.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
COUNT(DISTINCT fis.SalesOrderNumber) AS TotalOrders
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{TotalOrders} = |\{\text{SalesOrderNumber}_i : i \in \text{all transactions}\}|$$

where $|\cdot|$ denotes cardinality (count of unique values).

**Business Purpose:** Measures purchase frequency and customer engagement level. Higher values indicate more frequent purchasers.

## Examples
- Customer A: 50 orders → highly engaged, frequent buyer
- Customer B: 5 orders → moderate engagement
- Customer C: 1 order → one-time buyer, not yet loyal

---

# KPI 4: DaysSinceLastPurchase

## Definition
**DaysSinceLastPurchase** calculates the number of days from the customer's most recent purchase to the current date. This is the raw recency metric.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
(CURRENT_DATE - MAX(fis.OrderDate)::DATE) AS DaysSinceLastPurchase
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{DaysSinceLastPurchase} = \text{CURRENT\_DATE} - \text{LastPurchaseDate}$$

**Business Purpose:** Direct measure of customer recency, used to calculate RecencyScore and identify churn risk.

## Examples
- Customer A: 30 days since last purchase → active
- Customer B: 150 days since last purchase → at risk
- Customer C: 600 days since last purchase → likely churned

**Critical Thresholds (used in RecencyScore):**
- ≤60 days: Very active
- 61-120 days: Active
- 121-240 days: Declining
- 241-480 days: At risk
- >480 days: Churned

---

# KPI 5: CustomerTenureDays

## Definition
**CustomerTenureDays** measures the span of days between a customer's first and last purchase, representing the duration of their active relationship.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
(MAX(fis.OrderDate)::DATE - MIN(fis.OrderDate)::DATE) AS CustomerTenureDays
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{CustomerTenureDays} = \text{LastPurchaseDate} - \text{FirstPurchaseDate}$$

**Business Purpose:** Indicates the length of the customer relationship. Used to differentiate new customers from longstanding ones.

## Examples
- Customer A: First: 2020-01-01, Last: 2024-01-01 → 1461 days (4 years)
- Customer B: First: 2023-12-01, Last: 2024-01-01 → 31 days (new)
- Customer C: First: 2018-01-01, Last: 2024-01-01 → 2192 days (6 years)

**Note:** Single-purchase customers have 0 tenure days.

---

# KPI 6: TotalRevenue

## Definition
**TotalRevenue** sums all sales amounts across all customer purchases, representing their lifetime monetary contribution. This forms the Monetary dimension in RFM analysis.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
ROUND(SUM(fis.SalesAmount), 2) AS TotalRevenue
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{TotalRevenue} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{SalesAmount}_i$$

where $n$ is the total number of line items purchased.

**Business Purpose:** Primary monetary value metric for customer ranking. Used in MonetaryScore calculation.

## Examples
- Customer A: $100,000 total revenue → high-value customer
- Customer B: $5,000 total revenue → moderate-value customer
- Customer C: $200 total revenue → low-value customer

---

# KPI 7: TotalGrossProfit

## Definition
**TotalGrossProfit** calculates the cumulative gross profit (revenue minus product costs) generated by the customer, representing true margin contribution.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
ROUND(SUM(fis.SalesAmount - fis.TotalProductCost), 2) AS TotalGrossProfit
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{TotalGrossProfit} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (\text{SalesAmount}_i - \text{TotalProductCost}_i)$$

**Business Purpose:** More accurate value assessment than revenue alone. Identifies customers who buy high-margin vs. low-margin products.

## Examples
- Customer A: $100,000 revenue, $40,000 profit → 40% margin
- Customer B: $50,000 revenue, $5,000 profit → 10% margin (low-margin buyer)
- Customer C: $20,000 revenue, $14,000 profit → 70% margin (high-margin buyer)

---

# KPI 8: AvgTransactionValue

## Definition
**AvgTransactionValue** calculates the average sales amount per line item across all customer purchases, indicating typical transaction size.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
ROUND(AVG(fis.SalesAmount), 2) AS AvgTransactionValue
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{AvgTransactionValue} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{SalesAmount}_i$$

where $n$ is the total number of line items.

**Business Purpose:** Indicates price point preference and basket size characteristics.

## Examples
- Customer A: Average $500 per transaction → premium buyer
- Customer B: Average $50 per transaction → value buyer
- Customer C: Average $25 per transaction → discount/small-item buyer

---

# KPI 9: RecencyScore

## Definition
**RecencyScore** assigns a 1-5 score based on how recently the customer made their last purchase, with 5 being most recent. This quantifies the "R" in RFM analysis.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
CASE
    WHEN cph.DaysSinceLastPurchase <= 60 THEN 5
    WHEN cph.DaysSinceLastPurchase <= 120 THEN 4
    WHEN cph.DaysSinceLastPurchase <= 240 THEN 3
    WHEN cph.DaysSinceLastPurchase <= 480 THEN 2
    ELSE 1
END AS RecencyScore
```

**Mathematical Formula (Piecewise Function):**
$$\text{RecencyScore} = \begin{cases}
5 & \text{if } d \leq 60 \\
4 & \text{if } 60 < d \leq 120 \\
3 & \text{if } 120 < d \leq 240 \\
2 & \text{if } 240 < d \leq 480 \\
1 & \text{if } d > 480
\end{cases}$$

where $d = \text{DaysSinceLastPurchase}$.

**Range:** 1 to 5 (higher is better)

**Business Purpose:** Standardizes recency into a comparable score. Recency is the strongest predictor of future purchase behavior in RFM analysis.

## Examples
- Customer last purchased 45 days ago → RecencyScore = 5 (excellent)
- Customer last purchased 180 days ago → RecencyScore = 3 (moderate)
- Customer last purchased 600 days ago → RecencyScore = 1 (poor, likely churned)

**Interpretation:**
- **5**: Hot lead, very active
- **4**: Active, engaged
- **3**: Warm, needs nurturing
- **2**: At risk, requires attention
- **1**: Cold, churned or near-churned

---

# KPI 10: FrequencyScore

## Definition
**FrequencyScore** assigns customers to quintiles (1-5) based on total order count, with 5 representing the most frequent purchasers. This quantifies the "F" in RFM analysis.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
NTILE(5) OVER (ORDER BY cph.TotalOrders ASC) AS FrequencyScore
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{FrequencyScore} = \text{NTILE}_5(\text{TotalOrders}_{\text{asc}})$$

This divides customers into 5 equal-sized groups based on their TotalOrders rank (ascending order).

**Range:** 1 to 5 (higher is better)
- 5 = Top 20% (most frequent)
- 1 = Bottom 20% (least frequent)

**Business Purpose:** Standardizes purchase frequency into comparable quintiles, enabling cross-customer comparison regardless of absolute order counts.

## Examples
With 1,000 customers:
- **Score 5** (Rank 801-1000): Customers with most orders (e.g., 30+ orders)
- **Score 3** (Rank 401-600): Median frequency customers (e.g., 8-12 orders)
- **Score 1** (Rank 1-200): Customers with fewest orders (e.g., 1-3 orders)

**Note:** Using ASC ordering means higher order counts get higher scores.

---

# KPI 11: MonetaryScore

## Definition
**MonetaryScore** assigns customers to quintiles (1-5) based on total revenue, with 5 representing the highest-value customers. This quantifies the "M" in RFM analysis.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
NTILE(5) OVER (ORDER BY cph.TotalRevenue ASC) AS MonetaryScore
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{MonetaryScore} = \text{NTILE}_5(\text{TotalRevenue}_{\text{asc}})$$

**Range:** 1 to 5 (higher is better)
- 5 = Top 20% by revenue
- 1 = Bottom 20% by revenue

**Business Purpose:** Normalizes monetary value into comparable quintiles. Often reveals Pareto distribution (top 20% generate 60-80% of revenue).

## Examples
With $10M total revenue across 1,000 customers:
- **Score 5**: Top 200 customers, ~$7M revenue (~$35K average per customer)
- **Score 3**: Middle 200 customers, ~$1.5M revenue (~$7.5K average per customer)
- **Score 1**: Bottom 200 customers, ~$300K revenue (~$1.5K average per customer)

---

# KPI 12: RFMString

## Definition
**RFMString** concatenates the three RFM scores into a single 3-digit identifier (e.g., "555", "321") that uniquely identifies the customer's RFM profile.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
CAST(rfm.RecencyScore AS TEXT) || CAST(rfm.FrequencyScore AS TEXT) || CAST(rfm.MonetaryScore AS TEXT) AS RFMString
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{RFMString} = \text{concat}(R, F, M)$$

where $R, F, M \in \{1,2,3,4,5\}$.

**Range:** 111 to 555 (125 possible combinations)

**Business Purpose:** Provides a compact representation of customer profile for quick identification and segment grouping.

## Examples
- **"555"**: Best customers (recent, frequent, high-value) → Champions
- **"511"**: Recent and frequent but low spenders → Potential loyalists needing upsell
- **"111"**: Worst profile (old, infrequent, low-value) → Lost customers
- **"145"**: Not recent, infrequent, but high-value when they buy → Cannot lose them
- **"511"**: Very recent, infrequent, low value → New customers

**Pattern Analysis:**
- First digit = Recency (most predictive)
- Second digit = Frequency (loyalty indicator)
- Third digit = Monetary (value indicator)

---

# KPI 13: AvgRFMScore

## Definition
**AvgRFMScore** calculates the arithmetic mean of the three RFM scores, providing a single composite metric of overall customer quality.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
ROUND((rfm.RecencyScore + rfm.FrequencyScore + rfm.MonetaryScore) / 3.0, 2) AS AvgRFMScore
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{AvgRFMScore} = \frac{R + F + M}{3}$$

where $R, F, M \in \{1,2,3,4,5\}$.

**Range:** 1.00 to 5.00

**Business Purpose:** Simplifies customer comparison with a single metric. Useful for quick ranking when detailed segment analysis isn't needed.

## Examples
- Customer A: R=5, F=5, M=5 → AvgRFMScore = 5.00 (perfect)
- Customer B: R=4, F=4, M=3 → AvgRFMScore = 3.67 (good)
- Customer C: R=2, F=3, M=4 → AvgRFMScore = 3.00 (moderate, but not recent)
- Customer D: R=1, F=1, M=1 → AvgRFMScore = 1.00 (poor)

**Limitation:** Simple average treats all dimensions equally, but recency is typically most predictive. Segment-based classification (RFMSegment) is more nuanced.

---

# KPI 14: RFMSegment

## Definition
**RFMSegment** classifies customers into 11 strategic marketing segments based on their RFM score patterns. This is the core output of RFM analysis, translating scores into actionable business categories.

ROUND(AVG(rfms.TotalGrossProfit), 2) AS AvgLifetimeProfit
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{AvgLifetimeProfit}_s = \frac{1}{n_s}\sum_{c \in s} \text{TotalGrossProfit}(c)$$

**Business Purpose:** More accurate than revenue for investment decisions, as it accounts for cost structure and product mix differences.

## Examples
Expected averages by segment:
- Champions: $10,000 average profit (40% margin on $25K revenue)
- New Customers: $300 average profit (37.5% margin on $800 revenue)
- At Risk: $6,000 average profit (demonstrates value worth saving)

**Application:** If "At Risk" customers average $6K profit, spending up to $1K per customer on retention has strong ROI.

# KPI 24: TotalSegmentRevenue

## Definition
**TotalSegmentRevenue** sums the total revenue generated by all customers within a segment, showing absolute segment contribution.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
ROUND(SUM(rfms.TotalRevenue), 2) AS TotalSegmentRevenue
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{TotalSegmentRevenue}_s = \sum_{c \in s} \text{TotalRevenue}(c)$$

**Business Purpose:** Identifies which segments drive total business revenue, often revealing Pareto distributions.

## Examples
With $50M total revenue across segments:
- Champions (5% of customers): $20M revenue (40%)
- Loyal Customers (8% of customers): $12M revenue (24%)
- At Risk (4% of customers): $8M revenue (16%)
- Lost (12% of customers): $1M revenue (2%)

**Insight:** Top 13% of customers (Champions + Loyal) drive 64% of revenue - classic Pareto.

# KPI 25: RevenueSharePct (by Segment)

## Definition
**RevenueSharePct** calculates what percentage of total company revenue each segment generates, enabling proportional value assessment.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
ROUND(100.0 * SUM(rfms.TotalRevenue) / (SELECT SUM(TotalRevenue) FROM RFMSegmentation), 2) AS RevenueSharePct
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{RevenueSharePct}_s = \frac{\text{TotalSegmentRevenue}_s}{\sum_{s'} \text{TotalSegmentRevenue}_{s'}} \times 100$$

**Range:** 0% to 100%, sum across all segments = 100%

**Business Purpose:** Reveals disproportionate value concentration. Guides resource allocation and risk assessment.

## Examples
Typical distribution:
- Champions: 35% of revenue (5% of customers) → 7x concentration
- Loyal Customers: 25% of revenue (8% of customers) → 3.1x concentration
- New Customers: 5% of revenue (15% of customers) → 0.33x concentration
- At Risk: 15% of revenue (4% of customers) → 3.75x concentration (high value at risk!)
- Lost: 2% of revenue (12% of customers) → 0.17x concentration

**Strategic Insight:** "At Risk" segment with 15% revenue share from 4% of customers represents major risk if they churn.

# KPI 26: AvgYearlyIncome (by Segment)

## Definition
**AvgYearlyIncome** calculates the mean annual income of customers within each segment, revealing demographic-economic patterns.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
ROUND(AVG(rfms.YearlyIncome), 2) AS AvgYearlyIncome
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{AvgYearlyIncome}_s = \frac{1}{n_s}\sum_{c \in s} \text{YearlyIncome}(c)$$

**Business Purpose:** Links RFM behavior to economic capacity. Helps tailor messaging and product recommendations by segment income levels.

## Examples
Expected patterns:
- Champions: $85,000 average income (affluent)
- Loyal Customers: $72,000 average income
- New Customers: $65,000 average income (mixed demographic)
- Lost: $48,000 average income (may indicate product-market fit issues)

**Insight:** If "Champions" have significantly higher income, consider whether lower-income segments are being adequately served with appropriate product lines.

---

# KPI 27: MinLifetimeRevenue & MaxLifetimeRevenue (by Segment)

## Definition
**MinLifetimeRevenue** and **MaxLifetimeRevenue** show the range of customer values within each segment, revealing segment heterogeneity.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
MIN(rfms.TotalRevenue) AS MinLifetimeRevenue,
MAX(rfms.TotalRevenue) AS MaxLifetimeRevenue
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{MinLifetimeRevenue}_s = \min_{c \in s}(\text{TotalRevenue}(c))$$
$$\text{MaxLifetimeRevenue}_s = \max_{c \in s}(\text{TotalRevenue}(c))$$

**Business Purpose:** Identifies segments with high internal variance, suggesting potential for further sub-segmentation.

## Examples
Champions segment range:
- Min: $15,000
- Max: $250,000
- Range: $235,000 (high variance suggests sub-segments)

New Customers segment range:
- Min: $50
- Max: $5,000
- Range: $4,950 (indicates diverse entry points)

**Action:** High-variance segments may benefit from additional stratification (e.g., "Champions - Tier 1" for >$100K customers).

   - Scored 1-5 via quintile ranking

3. **Monetary (M):** How much do they spend?
   - Indicates customer value
   - Scored 1-5 via quintile ranking

### Segmentation Logic:
Combines RFM scores into 11 strategic segments:
- **Active/Valuable:** Champions, Loyal Customers, Potential Loyalists
- **New/Developing:** New Customers, Promising
- **Declining:** Need Attention, About To Sleep
