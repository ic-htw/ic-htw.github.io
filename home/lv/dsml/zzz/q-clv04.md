# Cross-Sell Opportunity Analysis - KPI Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of all Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) calculated in the cross-sell opportunity SQL query. The query uses product category affinity patterns to identify targeted cross-sell opportunities for high-value customers.

---

# KPI 1: LifetimeRevenue

## Definition
**LifetimeRevenue** sums the total sales amount across all purchases for each customer, representing their total monetary contribution to the business.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
ROUND(SUM(fis.SalesAmount), 2) AS LifetimeRevenue
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{LifetimeRevenue} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{SalesAmount}_i$$

where $n$ is the total number of transactions for the customer.

**Business Purpose:** Primary customer value metric used for segmentation and prioritization of cross-sell efforts.

## Examples
- Customer A: $75,000 lifetime revenue → high-value target
- Customer B: $12,000 lifetime revenue → medium-value target
- Customer C: $2,500 lifetime revenue → low-value target

---

# KPI 2: TotalOrders

## Definition
**TotalOrders** counts the number of distinct orders a customer has placed over their lifetime, measuring purchase frequency.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
COUNT(DISTINCT fis.SalesOrderNumber) AS TotalOrders
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{TotalOrders} = |\{\text{SalesOrderNumber}_i : i \in \text{all transactions}\}|$$

**Business Purpose:** Indicates customer engagement level and purchasing habits. Higher order counts suggest more established relationships.

# KPI 3: ValueQuartile

## Definition
**ValueQuartile** divides all customers into four equal groups (quartiles) based on lifetime revenue, with 1 being the top 25% highest-value customers and 4 being the bottom 25%.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY SUM(fis.SalesAmount) DESC) AS ValueQuartile
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{ValueQuartile} = \text{NTILE}_4(\text{LifetimeRevenue}_{\text{desc}})$$

This divides customers into 4 equal-sized groups ranked by revenue (descending).

**Values:** 1, 2, 3, 4 where:
- 1 = Top quartile (top 25%, highest revenue)
- 2 = Second quartile (25th-50th percentile)
- 3 = Third quartile (50th-75th percentile)
- 4 = Bottom quartile (bottom 25%, lowest revenue)

**Business Purpose:** Enables quartile-based analysis and targeting. Focuses cross-sell efforts on top quartiles with highest value potential.

## Examples
With 10,000 customers and $50M total revenue:

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
cap.CustomerCount AS AffinityStrength
```

This is the same as CustomerCount from CategoryAffinityPatterns, but contextualized as a recommendation confidence score.

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{AffinityStrength} = |\{\text{customers who bought both categories}\}|$$

**Business Purpose:** Higher values indicate more reliable recommendations based on broader customer behavior patterns. Low values suggest speculative or niche opportunities.

## Examples
Recommendation confidence levels:
- AffinityStrength = 2,500: Very high confidence (50% of 5,000 customers)
- AffinityStrength = 500: High confidence (10% of customers)
- AffinityStrength = 50: Moderate confidence (1% of customers)
- AffinityStrength = 10: Low confidence (minimum threshold, 0.2%)

**Usage in Messaging:**
- High strength (1000+): "Thousands of bike owners also love our accessories!"
- Medium strength (100-999): "Hundreds of customers have discovered this combination!"

- Expected ROI: $5,000 / $50 = 100x (if 100% conversion, 10x if 10% conversion)

**Opportunity B:**
- Customer owns: Accessories ($800 spent)
- Recommend: Clothing
- PotentialRevenue: $3,000 (combined average)
- Expected incremental revenue: ~$2,200
- Campaign cost: $20 per customer
- Expected ROI: $2,200 / $20 = 110x (if 100% conversion)

**Investment Decision:** Both opportunities justify investment, but Opportunity A has higher absolute potential.

# KPI 27: OpportunityRank

## Definition
**OpportunityRank** ranks cross-sell opportunities for each customer based on affinity strength and revenue potential, with rank 1 being the best opportunity for that customer.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY ccm.CustomerKey ORDER BY cap.CustomerCount DESC, cap.AvgCombinedRevenue DESC) AS OpportunityRank
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
For customer $k$:
$$\text{OpportunityRank}_k = \text{RANK}(\text{opportunities ordered by AffinityStrength desc, then PotentialRevenue desc})$$

**Ranking Logic:**
1. Primary sort: AffinityStrength (higher is better)
2. Secondary sort: PotentialRevenue (higher is better)

**Business Purpose:** Prioritizes which categories to recommend first for each customer. Limits campaign fatigue by focusing on top opportunities.

## Examples
Customer K's ranked opportunities:
1. **Rank 1**: Accessories (AffinityStrength: 2,500, PotentialRevenue: $8,500) → Top priority
2. **Rank 2**: Components (AffinityStrength: 1,200, PotentialRevenue: $12,000) → Second priority
3. **Rank 3**: Clothing (AffinityStrength: 800, PotentialRevenue: $5,000) → Third priority

**Campaign Strategy:**
- Send Rank 1 opportunity immediately
- Send Rank 2 opportunity 2 weeks later if no response
- Send Rank 3 opportunity 4 weeks later if no response
- Do not send Ranks 4+ to avoid over-communication

# KPI 30: CrossSellPriority

## Definition
**CrossSellPriority** assigns a priority level (Top/High/Medium/Low) to each cross-sell opportunity based on its OpportunityRank, guiding campaign timing and investment levels.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
CASE
    WHEN cso.OpportunityRank = 1 THEN 'Top Priority'
    WHEN cso.OpportunityRank <= 3 THEN 'High Priority'
    WHEN cso.OpportunityRank <= 5 THEN 'Medium Priority'
    ELSE 'Low Priority'
END AS CrossSellPriority
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{CrossSellPriority} = \begin{cases}
\text{Top Priority} & \text{if OpportunityRank} = 1 \\
\text{High Priority} & \text{if } 1 < \text{OpportunityRank} \leq 3 \\
\text{Medium Priority} & \text{if } 3 < \text{OpportunityRank} \leq 5 \\

# Summary: Cross-Sell Opportunity Framework

## Query Structure
The query builds cross-sell recommendations through seven progressive CTEs:

### CTE Flow:
1. **CustomerValueTier** → Segment customers by revenue quartile (KPI 1-4)
2. **CustomerCategoryPurchases** → Aggregate category-level purchase behavior (KPI 5-12)
3. **AllCategories** → List all available categories
4. **CustomerCategoryMatrix** → Create customer × category matrix (KPI 13)
5. **CustomerCategorySummary** → Calculate category penetration metrics (KPI 14-19)
6. **CategoryAffinityPatterns** → Identify category pairs frequently purchased together (KPI 20-22)
7. **CrossSellOpportunities** → Match customer gaps with affinity patterns (KPI 23-27)
8. **TopCrossSellOpportunities** → Rank and prioritize opportunities (KPI 28-31)

## Cross-Sell Methodology

### Core Concepts:

**1. Category Penetration**
- Measures how many of available categories each customer has purchased
- Low penetration = high cross-sell opportunity
- Formula: CategoriesPurchased / TotalCategories

**2. Affinity Analysis**
- Identifies category pairs frequently purchased together
- Based on actual customer behavior patterns
- Minimum threshold: 10+ customers for statistical significance

**3. Gap Analysis**
- Finds categories customer hasn't purchased (HasPurchasedCategory = 0)
- Matches gaps with strong affinity patterns
- Creates targeted recommendations

**4. Value-Based Prioritization**
- Focuses on High Value and Medium-High Value tiers
- Ranks opportunities by affinity strength and revenue potential
- Limits recommendations to top 5 per customer

## Business Applications

### 1. Personalized Product Recommendations
- **Website**: "Customers who bought [OwnedCategory] also bought [RecommendedCategory]"
- **Email**: Personalized product carousels based on affinity patterns
- **App**: Push notifications with category-specific offers

### 2. Campaign Segmentation
**High Value + Rank 1:**
- Personal outreach
- Premium offers (20-25% off)
- Account manager contact
- Expected conversion: 25-40%

**High Value + Ranks 2-5:**
- Targeted emails
- Category-specific benefits
- 15-20% discounts
- Expected conversion: 15-25%

**Medium-High Value:**
- Automated campaigns
- Bundle discounts (10-15% off)
- Email series
- Expected conversion: 8-15%

### 3. Revenue Expansion Strategies
**Depth (Within-Category):**
- Increase UniqueProductsInCategory
- Promote variety within owned categories

**Breadth (Cross-Category):**
- Increase CategoryPenetrationPct
- Move customers from 25% to 50% to 75% penetration

**Wallet Share:**
- Increase CategoryRevenue in underutilized categories
- Target high-affinity, low-revenue categories

### 4. Inventory and Merchandising
**Bundle Creation:**
- Create product bundles based on highest-affinity pairs
- "Bikes + Accessories Starter Pack"
- "Cycling Enthusiast Bundle (Accessories + Clothing + Components)"

**Store Layout:**
- Physical stores: Co-locate high-affinity categories
- E-commerce: Cross-link category pages based on affinity

**Assortment Planning:**
- Ensure adequate inventory of high-affinity pairs
- Coordinate promotions across affinity categories

### 5. Customer Lifecycle Management
**New Customer Onboarding:**
- First purchase in Category A → Trigger email for Category B (if high affinity)
- Accelerate path to multi-category buyer

**Churn Prevention:**
- Single-category buyers have higher churn risk
- Proactive cross-sell to increase stickiness
- Target: Move to 3+ categories within 90 days

**Reactivation:**
- Lapsed customers: Recommend new categories to spark interest
- "Haven't seen you in a while—check out our new [Category] line!"

## Key Metrics for Executive Dashboard

### Category Engagement Metrics:
- **Avg CategoryPenetrationPct**: Target 50%+ for high-value customers
- **% Customers with 1 Category**: Risk segment, target <30%
- **% Customers with 3+ Categories**: Loyal segment, target >40%

### Cross-Sell Performance:
- **Cross-Sell Conversion Rate** by ValueTier and Priority
  - High Value + Top Priority: Target 25-40%
  - Medium-High Value: Target 8-15%
- **Revenue from Cross-Sell**: Track incremental revenue from campaigns
- **Time to 2nd Category**: Days from first purchase to first cross-category purchase

### Affinity Insights:
- **Top Affinity Pairs** by CustomerCount
  - Example: 50% of customers buy Bikes + Accessories
- **High-Value Affinity Pairs** by AvgCombinedRevenue
  - Example: Bikes + Components = $12K average
- **Untapped Affinities**: Strong affinity, low current penetration = opportunity

### Campaign Economics:
- **Cost per Acquisition** (CPA) by approach
  - Personalized: $50-100 per customer
  - Targeted: $20-30 per customer
  - Automated: $5-10 per customer
- **ROI by ValueTier**
  - High Value: 10-20x ROI
  - Medium-High Value: 5-10x ROI
- **Lifetime Value Uplift**: Multi-category buyers vs. single-category
