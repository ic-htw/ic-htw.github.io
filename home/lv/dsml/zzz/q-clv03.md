# Customer Lifecycle Stage Analysis - KPI Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of all Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) calculated in the customer lifecycle stage SQL query. The query tracks customer progression through lifecycle stages and identifies stage transition opportunities.

---

# KPI 1: GrossProfit (per transaction)

## Definition
**GrossProfit** calculates the gross profit for each individual transaction by subtracting the total product cost from the sales amount. This measures the margin contribution of each sale.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
fis.SalesAmount - fis.TotalProductCost AS GrossProfit
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{GrossProfit} = \text{SalesAmount} - \text{TotalProductCost}$$

**Business Purpose:** Provides transaction-level profitability for margin analysis and customer value assessment.

## Examples
- Transaction A: $500 sales, $300 costs → $200 gross profit (40% margin)
- Transaction B: $1,000 sales, $950 costs → $50 gross profit (5% margin, low-margin sale)
- Transaction C: $200 sales, $80 costs → $120 gross profit (60% margin, high-margin sale)

---

# KPI 2: PurchaseSequence

## Definition
**PurchaseSequence** assigns a sequential order number to each transaction within a customer's purchase history, starting from 1 for their first purchase. This enables analysis of customer behavior evolution over time.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY fis.CustomerKey ORDER BY fis.OrderDate) AS PurchaseSequence
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{PurchaseSequence}_i = i \text{ where } i \text{ is the rank of transaction by OrderDate within customer}$$

For customer $c$, if transactions are ordered by date as $t_1, t_2, ..., t_n$, then:
$$\text{PurchaseSequence}(t_i) = i$$

**Business Purpose:** Enables cohort analysis, first-order vs. repeat-order comparisons, and tracking of customer journey progression.

## Examples
For Customer A's purchases:
- 2023-01-15: PurchaseSequence = 1 (first purchase)
- 2023-03-20: PurchaseSequence = 2 (second purchase)
- 2023-06-10: PurchaseSequence = 3 (third purchase)
- 2023-12-05: PurchaseSequence = 4 (fourth purchase)

**Analysis Applications:**
- Compare average order value for PurchaseSequence = 1 vs. > 1
- Analyze product preferences by purchase sequence
- Identify drop-off patterns (e.g., many customers with sequence = 1 only)

---

# KPI 3: CumulativeOrders

## Definition
**CumulativeOrders** counts the running total of distinct orders a customer has placed up to and including each transaction date. This shows the customer's order count at each point in their history.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
COUNT(DISTINCT fis.SalesOrderNumber) OVER (PARTITION BY fis.CustomerKey ORDER BY fis.OrderDate) AS CumulativeOrders
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{CumulativeOrders}(t_i) = |\{o : o \in \text{orders}, \text{OrderDate}(o) \leq \text{OrderDate}(t_i)\}|$$

where $|\cdot|$ denotes count of distinct orders up to transaction $t_i$.

**Business Purpose:** Tracks customer engagement progression and identifies when customers cross engagement thresholds (e.g., 5 orders, 10 orders).

## Examples
Customer B's timeline:
- Order 1 (2023-01-15, 3 line items): CumulativeOrders = 1, 1, 1 for each line
- Order 2 (2023-02-10, 2 line items): CumulativeOrders = 2, 2 for each line
- Order 3 (2023-04-20, 1 line item): CumulativeOrders = 3

**Note:** Multiple line items in same order have same CumulativeOrders value.

---

# KPI 4: CumulativeRevenue

## Definition
**CumulativeRevenue** calculates the running total of sales amount for a customer up to and including each transaction, showing their lifetime value progression over time.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
SUM(fis.SalesAmount) OVER (PARTITION BY fis.CustomerKey ORDER BY fis.OrderDate) AS CumulativeRevenue
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{CumulativeRevenue}(t_i) = \sum_{j=1}^{i} \text{SalesAmount}(t_j)$$

where transactions are ordered by date: $t_1, t_2, ..., t_i$.

**Business Purpose:** Tracks customer value accumulation, identifies high-value moments, and supports lifetime value projection models.

## Examples
Customer C's revenue progression:
- Transaction 1 (2023-01-01): $100 → CumulativeRevenue = $100
- Transaction 2 (2023-02-01): $150 → CumulativeRevenue = $250
- Transaction 3 (2023-03-01): $200 → CumulativeRevenue = $450
- Transaction 4 (2023-04-01): $175 → CumulativeRevenue = $625

**Analysis:**
- Identify when customers cross $1,000 threshold
- Calculate time-to-$X-revenue metrics
- Detect accelerating vs. decelerating value patterns

---

# KPI 5: PreviousOrderDate

## Definition
**PreviousOrderDate** retrieves the date of the customer's immediately preceding purchase, enabling calculation of inter-purchase intervals.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
LAG(fis.OrderDate) OVER (PARTITION BY fis.CustomerKey ORDER BY fis.OrderDate) AS PreviousOrderDate
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{PreviousOrderDate}(t_i) = \begin{cases}
\text{OrderDate}(t_{i-1}) & \text{if } i > 1 \\
\text{NULL} & \text{if } i = 1
\end{cases}$$

**Business Purpose:** Foundation for calculating time between purchases, detecting changes in purchase frequency, and identifying purchase cycle patterns.

## Examples
Customer D's purchase dates:
- Purchase 1 (2023-01-15): PreviousOrderDate = NULL (first purchase)
- Purchase 2 (2023-02-20): PreviousOrderDate = 2023-01-15
- Purchase 3 (2023-05-10): PreviousOrderDate = 2023-02-20
- Purchase 4 (2023-12-01): PreviousOrderDate = 2023-05-10

---

# KPI 6: DaysSincePreviousOrder

## Definition
**DaysSincePreviousOrder** calculates the number of days between consecutive purchases for the same customer, measuring inter-purchase interval.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
(fis.OrderDate::DATE - (LAG(fis.OrderDate) OVER (PARTITION BY fis.CustomerKey ORDER BY fis.OrderDate))::DATE) AS DaysSincePreviousOrder
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{DaysSincePreviousOrder}(t_i) = \begin{cases}
\text{OrderDate}(t_i) - \text{OrderDate}(t_{i-1}) & \text{if } i > 1 \\
\text{NULL} & \text{if } i = 1
\end{cases}$$

**Business Purpose:** Identifies natural purchase cycles, detects anomalies (unusually long/short intervals), and predicts next purchase timing.

## Examples
Customer E's inter-purchase intervals:
- Purchase 1 (2023-01-01): DaysSincePreviousOrder = NULL
- Purchase 2 (2023-01-31): DaysSincePreviousOrder = 30 days (monthly pattern)
- Purchase 3 (2023-03-02): DaysSincePreviousOrder = 30 days (consistent monthly)
- Purchase 4 (2023-06-15): DaysSincePreviousOrder = 105 days (deviation, potential issue)

**Alert Trigger:** If typical interval is 30 days but current is 90 days, trigger re-engagement campaign.

---

# KPI 7: FirstPurchaseDate

## Definition
**FirstPurchaseDate** identifies the date of the customer's very first purchase, establishing the customer relationship start date.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
MIN(cpt.OrderDate) AS FirstPurchaseDate
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{FirstPurchaseDate} = \min_{i}(\text{OrderDate}_i)$$

**Business Purpose:** Defines customer cohort membership, enables age-based analysis, and serves as baseline for tenure calculations.

## Examples
- Customer A: FirstPurchaseDate = 2020-06-15 → June 2020 cohort
- Customer B: FirstPurchaseDate = 2023-11-20 → November 2023 cohort
- Customer C: FirstPurchaseDate = 2019-01-03 → January 2019 cohort (oldest)

---

# KPI 8: LastPurchaseDate

## Definition
**LastPurchaseDate** identifies the date of the customer's most recent purchase, critical for recency analysis.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
MAX(cpt.OrderDate) AS LastPurchaseDate
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{LastPurchaseDate} = \max_{i}(\text{OrderDate}_i)$$

**Business Purpose:** Determines current activity status and is used to calculate days since last purchase for churn prediction.

## Examples
- Customer A: LastPurchaseDate = 2024-12-15 (recent, active)
- Customer B: LastPurchaseDate = 2023-06-20 (18 months ago, at risk)
- Customer C: LastPurchaseDate = 2021-08-10 (churned)

---

# KPI 9: CustomerAgeDays

## Definition
**CustomerAgeDays** calculates the total number of days since the customer's first purchase to the current date, representing the customer's age/tenure with the business.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
(CURRENT_DATE - MIN(cpt.OrderDate)::DATE) AS CustomerAgeDays
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{CustomerAgeDays} = \text{CURRENT\_DATE} - \text{FirstPurchaseDate}$$

**Business Purpose:** Differentiates new vs. longstanding customers, enables cohort-based comparisons, and supports lifecycle stage classification.

## Examples
- Customer A: First purchase 2023-12-10, analyzed 2024-01-10 → 31 days (new)
- Customer B: First purchase 2023-01-15, analyzed 2024-01-10 → 360 days (~1 year)
- Customer C: First purchase 2019-06-01, analyzed 2024-01-10 → 1,684 days (~4.6 years)

**Stage Thresholds:**
- 0-90 days: New customer phase
- 91-365 days: Developing phase
- 365+ days: Established customer

---

# KPI 10: DaysSinceLastPurchase

## Definition
**DaysSinceLastPurchase** calculates the number of days from the customer's last purchase to the current date, the primary recency metric.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
(CURRENT_DATE - MAX(cpt.OrderDate)::DATE) AS DaysSinceLastPurchase
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{DaysSinceLastPurchase} = \text{CURRENT\_DATE} - \text{LastPurchaseDate}$$

**Business Purpose:** Primary indicator of churn risk. Used to trigger retention campaigns and classify lifecycle stages.

## Examples
- Customer A: 15 days since last purchase → active
- Customer B: 200 days since last purchase → at risk
- Customer C: 400 days since last purchase → likely churned

**Critical Thresholds:**
- 0-180 days: Active engagement
- 181-365 days: At-risk zone
- 365+ days: Churned

---

# KPI 11: ActiveLifespanDays

## Definition
**ActiveLifespanDays** measures the time span between a customer's first and last purchase, representing the duration of their active purchasing period (distinct from CustomerAgeDays which measures from first purchase to today).

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
(MAX(cpt.OrderDate)::DATE - MIN(cpt.OrderDate)::DATE) AS ActiveLifespanDays
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{ActiveLifespanDays} = \text{LastPurchaseDate} - \text{FirstPurchaseDate}$$

**Relationship:**
$$\text{CustomerAgeDays} = \text{ActiveLifespanDays} + \text{DaysSinceLastPurchase}$$

**Business Purpose:** Measures actual engagement duration. A customer with 1000 CustomerAgeDays but 100 ActiveLifespanDays was only active for 100 days then churned.

## Examples
- Customer A: First 2023-01-01, Last 2024-01-01 → ActiveLifespanDays = 365
  - If today is 2024-06-01, CustomerAgeDays = 517, DaysSinceLastPurchase = 152
- Customer B: First 2023-01-01, Last 2023-01-15 → ActiveLifespanDays = 14 (one-time buyer)
  - If today is 2024-01-01, CustomerAgeDays = 365, DaysSinceLastPurchase = 351

**Interpretation:**
- High ActiveLifespanDays: Long engagement period (loyal)
- Low ActiveLifespanDays: Short engagement burst (may be one-time or seasonal)

---

# KPI 12: TotalOrders

## Definition
**TotalOrders** counts the total number of distinct orders a customer has placed over their lifetime.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
COUNT(DISTINCT cpt.SalesOrderNumber) AS TotalOrders
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{TotalOrders} = |\{\text{SalesOrderNumber}_i : i \in \text{all transactions}\}|$$

**Business Purpose:** Primary frequency metric. Used to classify customers into engagement tiers and lifecycle stages.

## Examples
- Customer A: 25 orders → highly engaged
- Customer B: 3 orders → moderate engagement
- Customer C: 1 order → one-time buyer

**Stage Classification Thresholds:**
- 1-2 orders: New
- 3-4 orders: Developing
- 5-10 orders: Growing
- 11+ orders: Mature

---

# KPI 13: MaxOrders

## Definition
**MaxOrders** retrieves the maximum value of CumulativeOrders, which should equal TotalOrders. This is a verification metric to ensure window function calculations are correct.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
MAX(cpt.CumulativeOrders) AS MaxOrders
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{MaxOrders} = \max_{i}(\text{CumulativeOrders}_i) = \text{TotalOrders}$$

**Business Purpose:** Quality assurance check. MaxOrders should always equal TotalOrders.

## Examples
- If TotalOrders = 10 and MaxOrders = 10 → Correct
- If TotalOrders = 10 and MaxOrders = 9 → Data quality issue

---

# KPI 14: TotalRevenue

## Definition
**TotalRevenue** sums all sales amounts across all customer transactions, representing lifetime monetary contribution.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
ROUND(SUM(cpt.SalesAmount), 2) AS TotalRevenue
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{TotalRevenue} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{SalesAmount}_i$$

**Business Purpose:** Primary customer value metric. Used for ranking, segmentation, and ROI analysis.

## Examples
- Customer A: $50,000 total revenue → high-value
- Customer B: $2,500 total revenue → moderate-value
- Customer C: $150 total revenue → low-value

---

# KPI 15: TotalGrossProfit

## Definition
**TotalGrossProfit** sums the gross profit across all customer transactions, representing lifetime margin contribution.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
ROUND(SUM(cpt.GrossProfit), 2) AS TotalGrossProfit
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{TotalGrossProfit} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{GrossProfit}_i = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (\text{SalesAmount}_i - \text{TotalProductCost}_i)$$

**Business Purpose:** More accurate value metric than revenue, accounting for cost structure and margin differences.

## Examples
- Customer A: $50,000 revenue, $20,000 profit → 40% lifetime margin
- Customer B: $10,000 revenue, $8,000 profit → 80% lifetime margin (high-margin buyer)
- Customer C: $100,000 revenue, $5,000 profit → 5% lifetime margin (low-margin buyer)

**Insight:** Customer B is more valuable per dollar than Customer C despite lower revenue.

---

# KPI 16: AvgTransactionValue

## Definition
**AvgTransactionValue** calculates the mean sales amount per line item across all customer purchases.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
ROUND(AVG(cpt.SalesAmount), 2) AS AvgTransactionValue
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{AvgTransactionValue} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{SalesAmount}_i$$

where $n$ is the total number of line items.

**Business Purpose:** Indicates typical basket size and price point preference.

## Examples
- Customer A: $250 average → premium buyer
- Customer B: $50 average → mid-market buyer
- Customer C: $15 average → value/discount buyer

---

# KPI 17: AvgDaysBetweenOrders (calculated from timeline)

## Definition
**AvgDaysBetweenOrders** calculates the mean number of days between consecutive purchases, indicating the customer's natural purchase cycle.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
ROUND(AVG(cpt.DaysSincePreviousOrder), 2) AS AvgDaysBetweenOrders
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{AvgDaysBetweenOrders} = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=2}^{n} \text{DaysSincePreviousOrder}_i$$

where $n$ is the total number of orders.

**Business Purpose:** Identifies natural replenishment cycle. Used for timing re-engagement campaigns and predicting next purchase.

## Examples
- Customer A: 30 days average → monthly buyer
- Customer B: 90 days average → quarterly buyer
- Customer C: 7 days average → weekly buyer (possible business/reseller)

**Application:** If customer typically orders every 30 days but hasn't ordered in 60 days, trigger campaign.

---

# KPI 18: AvgPurchaseCycleDays

## Definition
**AvgPurchaseCycleDays** calculates an alternative measure of inter-purchase interval by dividing the total active lifespan by the number of purchase intervals. This provides a different perspective than AvgDaysBetweenOrders.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
ROUND(CAST((MAX(cpt.OrderDate)::DATE - MIN(cpt.OrderDate)::DATE) AS DOUBLE) / NULLIF(COUNT(DISTINCT cpt.SalesOrderNumber) - 1, 0), 2) AS AvgPurchaseCycleDays
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{AvgPurchaseCycleDays} = \frac{\text{ActiveLifespanDays}}{\text{TotalOrders} - 1} = \frac{\text{LastPurchaseDate} - \text{FirstPurchaseDate}}{\text{TotalOrders} - 1}$$

**Relationship:**
$$\text{AvgPurchaseCycleDays} \approx \text{AvgDaysBetweenOrders}$$

These should be similar but may differ slightly due to calculation method.

**Business Purpose:** Alternative measure of purchase frequency that's less sensitive to individual transaction variations.

## Examples
- Customer A: First 2023-01-01, Last 2023-12-31, 13 orders
  - AvgPurchaseCycleDays = 365 / (13-1) = 30.4 days
- Customer B: First 2023-01-01, Last 2023-07-01, 7 orders
  - AvgPurchaseCycleDays = 182 / (7-1) = 30.3 days

**Note:** For single-order customers, this is NULL (division by zero protection).

---

# KPI 19: CustomerAgeYears

## Definition
**CustomerAgeYears** converts CustomerAgeDays into years for more intuitive understanding of customer tenure.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
ROUND(ccs.CustomerAgeDays / 365.25, 2) AS CustomerAgeYears
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{CustomerAgeYears} = \frac{\text{CustomerAgeDays}}{365.25}$$

**Business Purpose:** Human-readable tenure metric for reporting and segmentation.

## Examples
- 30 days → 0.08 years (~1 month)
- 365 days → 1.00 years
- 1095 days → 3.00 years
- 1825 days → 5.00 years

---

# KPI 20: LifecycleStage

## Definition
**LifecycleStage** classifies customers into one of seven strategic lifecycle stages based on their age, engagement level, and recency. This is the core classification metric that drives all lifecycle-based strategies.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
CASE
    WHEN ccs.DaysSinceLastPurchase > 365 THEN 'Churned'
    WHEN ccs.DaysSinceLastPurchase > 180 AND ccs.TotalOrders >= 3 THEN 'At-Risk'
    WHEN ccs.CustomerAgeDays <= 90 AND ccs.TotalOrders <= 2 THEN 'New'
    WHEN (ccs.CustomerAgeDays BETWEEN 91 AND 180) OR (ccs.TotalOrders BETWEEN 2 AND 4) THEN 'Developing'
    WHEN (ccs.CustomerAgeDays BETWEEN 181 AND 365) OR (ccs.TotalOrders BETWEEN 5 AND 10) THEN 'Growing'
    WHEN ccs.CustomerAgeDays > 365 AND ccs.TotalOrders >= 11 AND ccs.DaysSinceLastPurchase <= 180 THEN 'Mature'
    ELSE 'Inactive'
END AS LifecycleStage
```

**Stage Definitions:**

- Various patterns not captured above
- Generally low engagement
- Mixed age and order counts
- May include edge cases

**Example:** Customer 200 days old, 2 orders, last purchase 100 days ago → Inactive

**Business Purpose:** Provides clear, actionable segmentation for lifecycle marketing strategies. Each stage has distinct needs and optimal interventions.

## Examples

**Lifecycle Progression Examples:**

**Customer Journey 1 (Successful):**
1. Day 1: First purchase → New
2. Day 45: Second purchase → New (still < 90 days, ≤ 2 orders)
3. Day 95: Third purchase → Developing (passed 90 days)
4. Day 150: Fifth purchase → Growing (5 orders)
5. Day 400: Twelfth purchase → Mature (>365 days, 11+ orders, recent)

**Customer Journey 2 (At Risk):**
1. Day 1-300: Accumulate 10 orders → Growing
2. Day 400: 11th purchase → Would be Mature if purchased recently
3. Day 600: No purchases for 200 days → At-Risk (>180 days, had 11 orders)
4. Day 900: No purchases for 500 days → Churned (>365 days)

**Customer Journey 3 (Quick Churn):**
1. Day 1: First purchase → New

```sql
CASE lsa.LifecycleStage
    WHEN 'New' THEN CONCAT(GREATEST(0, 3 - lsa.TotalOrders), ' more orders OR ', GREATEST(0, 91 - lsa.CustomerAgeDays), ' more days')
    WHEN 'Developing' THEN CONCAT(GREATEST(0, 5 - lsa.TotalOrders), ' more orders needed for Growing stage')
    WHEN 'Growing' THEN CONCAT(GREATEST(0, 11 - lsa.TotalOrders), ' more orders needed for Mature stage')
    WHEN 'At-Risk' THEN CONCAT('Purchase within ', GREATEST(0, 180 - lsa.DaysSinceLastPurchase), ' days to avoid churn')
    WHEN 'Churned' THEN 'Win-back campaign required'
    ELSE 'N/A'
END AS StageProgressionGap
```

**Gap Calculations by Stage:**

### New → Developing
**Gap:** $\max(0, 3 - \text{TotalOrders})$ orders OR $\max(0, 91 - \text{CustomerAgeDays})$ days

**Logic:** Need 3 orders or 91 days to graduate to Developing

**Examples:**
- Customer with 1 order, 30 days old → "2 more orders OR 61 more days"
- Customer with 2 orders, 85 days old → "1 more orders OR 6 more days"

### Developing → Growing
**Gap:** $\max(0, 5 - \text{TotalOrders})$ orders

**Logic:** Need 5 orders to reach Growing stage

**Examples:**
- Customer with 3 orders → "2 more orders needed for Growing stage"
- Customer with 4 orders → "1 more orders needed for Growing stage"

### Growing → Mature
**Gap:** $\max(0, 11 - \text{TotalOrders})$ orders

**Logic:** Need 11 orders (and be over 365 days old with recency < 180 days)

**Examples:**
- Customer with 7 orders → "4 more orders needed for Mature stage"
- Customer with 10 orders → "1 more orders needed for Mature stage"

### At-Risk (avoiding churn)
**Gap:** Purchase within $(180 - \text{DaysSinceLastPurchase})$ days

**Logic:** Must purchase before reaching 365 days of inactivity (churned threshold)

**Examples:**
- Customer at-risk for 200 days → "Purchase within -20 days to avoid churn" (already in danger zone)
- Customer at-risk for 220 days → "Purchase within -40 days to avoid churn" (critical)

**Note:** Negative values indicate already past safe threshold.

**Business Purpose:** Translates strategic goals into concrete, measurable actions. Enables personalized messaging (e.g., "Just 2 more orders to unlock Growing benefits!").

## Examples
- New customer with 1 order, 45 days → "2 more orders OR 46 more days"
- Developing customer with 3 orders → "2 more orders needed for Growing stage"
- At-Risk customer, 250 days inactive → "Purchase within -70 days..." (urgent!)

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY lsa.LifecycleStage ORDER BY lsa.TotalRevenue DESC) AS StageRevenueRank
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{StageRevenueRank}_s(c) = |\{c' \in s : \text{TotalRevenue}(c') > \text{TotalRevenue}(c)\}| + 1$$

for customer $c$ in stage $s$.

**Business Purpose:** Prioritizes within-stage actions. Identifies highest-value customers in At-Risk stage for immediate intervention.

## Examples
In At-Risk stage with 500 customers:
- Customer A: $50,000 revenue → StageRevenueRank = 1 (highest priority)
- Customer B: $35,000 revenue → StageRevenueRank = 5
- Customer C: $5,000 revenue → StageRevenueRank = 250 (medium priority)
- Customer D: $500 revenue → StageRevenueRank = 490 (low priority)

**Application:**
