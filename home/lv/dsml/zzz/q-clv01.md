# Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Analysis - KPI Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of all Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) calculated in the customer lifetime value SQL query. The query uses a multi-CTE approach to build progressively more sophisticated customer analytics metrics.

---

# KPI 1: FirstPurchaseDate

## Definition
**FirstPurchaseDate** represents the date of a customer's very first purchase transaction in the system. This establishes the beginning of the customer relationship timeline.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
MIN(fis.OrderDate) AS FirstPurchaseDate
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{FirstPurchaseDate} = \min(\text{OrderDate}_i) \text{ for all orders } i \text{ of customer}$$

**Business Purpose:** Identifies when a customer entered the business ecosystem, enabling cohort analysis and customer age calculations.

## Examples
- Customer A made their first purchase on 2020-01-15
- Customer B made their first purchase on 2019-06-23
- Used to calculate: How long has this customer been with us?

---

# KPI 2: LastPurchaseDate

## Definition
**LastPurchaseDate** represents the date of a customer's most recent purchase transaction. This is critical for recency analysis and identifying at-risk customers.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
MAX(fis.OrderDate) AS LastPurchaseDate
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{LastPurchaseDate} = \max(\text{OrderDate}_i) \text{ for all orders } i \text{ of customer}$$

**Business Purpose:** Determines customer recency, helping identify active vs. dormant customers.

## Examples
- Customer A last purchased on 2024-12-20 (active customer)
- Customer B last purchased on 2022-03-15 (potentially churned)
- Used to calculate: When did we last engage with this customer?

---

# KPI 3: TotalOrders

## Definition
**TotalOrders** counts the number of distinct purchase orders a customer has placed over their entire relationship with the business. This measures purchase frequency at the order level.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
COUNT(DISTINCT fis.SalesOrderNumber) AS TotalOrders
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{TotalOrders} = |\{\text{SalesOrderNumber}_i : i \in \text{all transactions}\}|$$

where $|\cdot|$ denotes the cardinality (count) of unique order numbers.

**Business Purpose:** Measures customer engagement frequency and loyalty. Higher values indicate more frequent purchasers.

## Examples
- Customer A: 45 orders over 3 years (highly engaged)
- Customer B: 2 orders over 5 years (low engagement)
- Customer C: 150 orders over 2 years (champion customer)

---

# KPI 4: TotalLineItems

## Definition
**TotalLineItems** counts the total number of individual product line items purchased across all orders. This differs from TotalOrders as a single order can contain multiple line items.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
COUNT(*) AS TotalLineItems
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{TotalLineItems} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 1 \text{ for all line items } i$$

**Relationship:**
$$\text{TotalLineItems} \geq \text{TotalOrders}$$

**Business Purpose:** Measures basket size indirectly and total transaction volume. The ratio TotalLineItems/TotalOrders indicates average items per order.

## Examples
- Customer with 10 orders and 10 line items: always buys single items
- Customer with 10 orders and 50 line items: averages 5 items per order (basket buyer)
- High line items suggest cross-selling success

---

# KPI 5: CustomerTenureDays

## Definition
**CustomerTenureDays** calculates the number of days between a customer's first and last purchase, representing the span of their active relationship with the business.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
(MAX(fis.OrderDate)::DATE - MIN(fis.OrderDate)::DATE) AS CustomerTenureDays
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{CustomerTenureDays} = \text{LastPurchaseDate} - \text{FirstPurchaseDate}$$

where dates are treated as integers (days since epoch).

**Business Purpose:** Measures the duration of the customer relationship, used for annualizing metrics and understanding customer lifecycle stages.

## Examples
- Customer A: First purchase 2020-01-01, Last purchase 2023-01-01 → 1095 days (3 years)
- Customer B: First purchase 2024-01-01, Last purchase 2024-01-15 → 14 days (new customer)
- Customer C: First purchase 2018-06-15, Last purchase 2024-12-31 → ~2390 days (6.5 years)

**Note:** For customers with only one order, this value is 0.

---

# KPI 6: CustomerTenureYears

## Definition
**CustomerTenureYears** converts CustomerTenureDays into years using the precise astronomical year length (365.25 days to account for leap years).

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
ROUND(cflp.CustomerTenureDays / 365.25, 2) AS CustomerTenureYears
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{CustomerTenureYears} = \frac{\text{CustomerTenureDays}}{365.25}$$

**Business Purpose:** Provides a human-readable tenure measure and serves as the denominator for annualized metrics (revenue per year, orders per year, etc.).

## Examples
- 1095 days → 3.00 years
- 730 days → 2.00 years
- 183 days → 0.50 years (6 months)
- 0 days → 0.00 years (single-order customer)

---

# KPI 7: DaysSinceLastPurchase

## Definition
**DaysSinceLastPurchase** calculates the number of days from the customer's last purchase to the current date. This is the primary recency metric for identifying customer activity status.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
(CURRENT_DATE - cflp.LastPurchaseDate::DATE) AS DaysSinceLastPurchase
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{DaysSinceLastPurchase} = \text{CURRENT\_DATE} - \text{LastPurchaseDate}$$

**Business Purpose:** Critical for churn prediction and customer reactivation campaigns. Low values indicate active customers; high values suggest churn risk.

## Examples
- Customer A: Last purchased 15 days ago → highly active
- Customer B: Last purchased 180 days ago → at-risk customer
- Customer C: Last purchased 730 days ago (2 years) → likely churned

**Interpretation Thresholds:**
- 0-30 days: Active
- 31-90 days: Engaged
- 91-180 days: At-risk
- 181-365 days: Churning
- 365+ days: Churned

---

# KPI 8: UniquePurchaseDays

## Definition
**UniquePurchaseDays** counts the number of distinct calendar days on which a customer made at least one purchase. This measures purchase day diversity.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
COUNT(DISTINCT DATE(fis.OrderDate)) AS UniquePurchaseDays
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{UniquePurchaseDays} = |\{\text{DATE}(\text{OrderDate}_i) : i \in \text{all orders}\}|$$

**Relationship:**
$$\text{UniquePurchaseDays} \leq \text{TotalOrders} \leq \text{TotalLineItems}$$

**Business Purpose:** Differentiates customers who place multiple orders on the same day vs. those who spread purchases over time. Used to calculate activity concentration.

## Examples
- Customer with 10 orders on 10 different days: UniquePurchaseDays = 10
- Customer with 10 orders all on same day: UniquePurchaseDays = 1 (bulk buyer)
- Customer with 10 orders over 5 days: UniquePurchaseDays = 5 (averages 2 orders per shopping day)

---

# KPI 9: TotalUnits

## Definition
**TotalUnits** represents the total quantity of product units purchased by the customer across all transactions, regardless of product type.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
SUM(fis.OrderQuantity) AS TotalUnits
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{TotalUnits} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{OrderQuantity}_i$$

where $n$ is the number of line items.

**Business Purpose:** Measures total volume consumption and can indicate wholesale vs. retail buying behavior.

## Examples
- Customer A: 500 units over 10 orders → average 50 units/order (possible reseller)
- Customer B: 25 units over 25 orders → average 1 unit/order (individual consumer)
- Customer C: 1,000 units in single order → bulk/wholesale buyer

---

# KPI 10: LifetimeRevenue

## Definition
**LifetimeRevenue** is the total sales amount generated by a customer across all their purchases. This is the most fundamental customer value metric and represents the top-line contribution.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
ROUND(SUM(fis.SalesAmount), 2) AS LifetimeRevenue
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{LifetimeRevenue} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{SalesAmount}_i$$

where $\text{SalesAmount}_i$ is the revenue from line item $i$.

**Business Purpose:** Primary metric for customer ranking and segmentation. Used in Pareto analysis (80/20 rule) and customer tiering.

## Examples
- Customer A: $50,000 lifetime revenue → high-value customer
- Customer B: $500 lifetime revenue → low-value customer
- Customer C: $250,000 lifetime revenue → VIP/whale customer

**Typical Distribution:** Often follows Pareto principle where top 20% of customers generate 80% of revenue.

---

# KPI 11: LifetimeGrossProfit

## Definition
**LifetimeGrossProfit** calculates the total gross profit (revenue minus product cost) generated by a customer over their lifetime. This represents the actual margin contribution before operating expenses.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
ROUND(SUM(fis.SalesAmount - fis.TotalProductCost), 2) AS LifetimeGrossProfit
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{LifetimeGrossProfit} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (\text{SalesAmount}_i - \text{TotalProductCost}_i)$$

$$= \text{LifetimeRevenue} - \text{TotalProductCosts}$$

**Business Purpose:** More accurate customer value metric than revenue alone, as it accounts for cost of goods sold. Critical for profitability analysis.

## Examples
- Customer A: $50,000 revenue, $30,000 product costs → $20,000 gross profit
- Customer B: $100,000 revenue, $95,000 product costs → $5,000 gross profit (low-margin buyer)
- Customer C: $20,000 revenue, $8,000 product costs → $12,000 gross profit (high-margin buyer)

**Note:** Customer C is more valuable than Customer B despite lower revenue.

---

# KPI 12: LifetimeMarginPct

## Definition
**LifetimeMarginPct** expresses the gross profit margin as a percentage of revenue, indicating the profitability rate of a customer's purchases.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
ROUND(100.0 * SUM(fis.SalesAmount - fis.TotalProductCost) / NULLIF(SUM(fis.SalesAmount), 0), 2) AS LifetimeMarginPct
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{LifetimeMarginPct} = \frac{\text{LifetimeGrossProfit}}{\text{LifetimeRevenue}} \times 100$$

$$= \frac{\sum (\text{SalesAmount}_i - \text{TotalProductCost}_i)}{\sum \text{SalesAmount}_i} \times 100$$

**Range:** 0% to 100% (higher is better)

**Business Purpose:** Identifies customers who buy high-margin vs. low-margin products. Useful for targeted promotions and product recommendations.

## Examples
- Customer A: $10,000 revenue, $4,000 profit → 40% margin (excellent)
- Customer B: $100,000 revenue, $5,000 profit → 5% margin (poor)
- Customer C: $50,000 revenue, $15,000 profit → 30% margin (good)

**Industry Context:** Margins vary by industry. Luxury goods: 60-80%, Electronics: 5-15%, Grocery: 2-5%.

---

# KPI 13: AvgLineItemValue

## Definition
**AvgLineItemValue** calculates the average sales amount per individual line item (product) purchased. This indicates typical transaction size at the most granular level.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
ROUND(AVG(fis.SalesAmount), 2) AS AvgLineItemValue
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{AvgLineItemValue} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{SalesAmount}_i}{n}$$

where $n$ is the total number of line items.

$$= \frac{\text{LifetimeRevenue}}{\text{TotalLineItems}}$$

**Business Purpose:** Indicates price point preference. Low values suggest discount/value buyers; high values suggest premium buyers.

## Examples
- Customer A: $10,000 revenue, 100 line items → $100 average line item (mid-market)
- Customer B: $10,000 revenue, 20 line items → $500 average line item (premium buyer)
- Customer C: $10,000 revenue, 500 line items → $20 average line item (discount buyer)

---

# KPI 14: AvgOrderValue

## Definition
**AvgOrderValue (AOV)** calculates the average total sales amount per order. This is a critical e-commerce and retail metric indicating typical basket size.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
ROUND(SUM(fis.SalesAmount) / NULLIF(cflp.TotalOrders, 0), 2) AS AvgOrderValue
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{AvgOrderValue} = \frac{\text{LifetimeRevenue}}{\text{TotalOrders}}$$

$$= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{SalesAmount}_i}{\text{Number of distinct orders}}$$

**Relationship:**
$$\text{AvgOrderValue} = \text{AvgLineItemValue} \times \frac{\text{TotalLineItems}}{\text{TotalOrders}}$$

**Business Purpose:** Key metric for cross-selling and upselling effectiveness. Higher AOV reduces transaction costs and improves profitability.

## Examples
- Customer A: $50,000 revenue, 100 orders → $500 AOV
- Customer B: $50,000 revenue, 500 orders → $100 AOV (frequent small purchases)
- Customer C: $50,000 revenue, 10 orders → $5,000 AOV (bulk/wholesale buyer)

**Optimization Target:** Increasing AOV by 10% is often easier than increasing customer count by 10%.

---

# KPI 15: TotalDiscounts

## Definition
**TotalDiscounts** sums all discount amounts applied to a customer's purchases over their lifetime, representing the total price reduction granted.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
ROUND(SUM(fis.DiscountAmount), 2) AS TotalDiscounts
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{TotalDiscounts} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{DiscountAmount}_i$$

**Business Purpose:** Measures the customer's sensitivity to promotions and the cost of acquiring/retaining them. High discounts may indicate margin erosion.

## Examples
- Customer A: $50,000 revenue, $5,000 discounts → discount-driven buyer
- Customer B: $50,000 revenue, $500 discounts → full-price buyer
- Customer C: $10,000 revenue, $8,000 discounts → extreme promotion dependency

---

# KPI 16: AvgDiscountPct

## Definition
**AvgDiscountPct** calculates the average discount rate as a percentage of the original price (before discount). This normalizes discount behavior across different purchase sizes.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
ROUND(100.0 * SUM(fis.DiscountAmount) / NULLIF(SUM(fis.SalesAmount + fis.DiscountAmount), 0), 2) AS AvgDiscountPct
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{AvgDiscountPct} = \frac{\sum \text{DiscountAmount}_i}{\sum (\text{SalesAmount}_i + \text{DiscountAmount}_i)} \times 100$$

$$= \frac{\text{TotalDiscounts}}{\text{Original Price (before discounts)}} \times 100$$

**Range:** 0% to 100%

**Business Purpose:** Identifies promotional dependency and customer price sensitivity. Used for targeted discount strategies.

## Examples
- Customer A: $10,000 final price, $1,000 discounts → 9.09% average discount
- Customer B: $10,000 final price, $5,000 discounts → 33.33% average discount (highly promotional)
- Customer C: $10,000 final price, $0 discounts → 0% (full-price customer)

**Strategy Insight:** Customers with >20% avg discount may have learned to wait for sales.

---

# KPI 17: UniqueCategories

## Definition
**UniqueCategories** counts the number of distinct product categories a customer has purchased from, measuring product diversity at the category level.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
COUNT(DISTINCT pc.EnglishProductCategoryName) AS UniqueCategories
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{UniqueCategories} = |\{\text{ProductCategory}_i : i \in \text{all purchases}\}|$$

**Business Purpose:** Measures cross-category engagement. Higher values indicate customers exploring the full product range, suggesting stronger loyalty and share-of-wallet.

## Examples
- Customer A purchased from 1 category (Bikes only) → specialist buyer
- Customer B purchased from 4 categories (Bikes, Clothing, Accessories, Components) → diverse buyer
- If only 4 categories exist total, Customer B is a full-catalog customer

---

# KPI 18: UniqueProducts

## Definition
**UniqueProducts** counts the number of distinct products (SKUs) a customer has purchased, measuring product diversity at the most granular level.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
COUNT(DISTINCT fis.ProductKey) AS UniqueProducts
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{UniqueProducts} = |\{\text{ProductKey}_i : i \in \text{all purchases}\}|$$

**Relationship:**
$$\text{UniqueProducts} \leq \text{TotalLineItems}$$

(equality holds when customer never repurchases same product)

**Business Purpose:** Indicates variety-seeking vs. repeat-buying behavior. High values suggest exploratory customers; low values suggest loyal repurchasers.

## Examples
- Customer A: 100 line items, 100 unique products → 100% variety (never repurchases)
- Customer B: 100 line items, 10 unique products → 10% variety (high repurchase rate, averages 10 units per SKU)
- Customer C: 100 line items, 50 unique products → 50% variety (moderate repurchase)

---

# KPI 19: RevenuePerYear

## Definition
**RevenuePerYear** annualizes the lifetime revenue by dividing by tenure in years, providing a normalized measure of customer value independent of relationship length.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
ROUND(clm.LifetimeRevenue / NULLIF(clm.CustomerTenureYears, 0), 2) AS RevenuePerYear
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{RevenuePerYear} = \frac{\text{LifetimeRevenue}}{\text{CustomerTenureYears}}$$

**Business Purpose:** Enables fair comparison between new and longstanding customers. A 3-year customer with $30,000 revenue equals a 1-year customer with $10,000 revenue in annual terms.

## Examples
- Customer A: $50,000 lifetime revenue over 5 years → $10,000/year
- Customer B: $20,000 lifetime revenue over 1 year → $20,000/year (higher rate!)
- Customer C: $100,000 lifetime revenue over 10 years → $10,000/year

**Note:** Customer B, despite lower total revenue, is more valuable on an annual basis.

---

# KPI 20: ProfitPerYear

## Definition
**ProfitPerYear** annualizes the lifetime gross profit, showing the annual margin contribution of a customer.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
ROUND(clm.LifetimeGrossProfit / NULLIF(clm.CustomerTenureYears, 0), 2) AS ProfitPerYear
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{ProfitPerYear} = \frac{\text{LifetimeGrossProfit}}{\text{CustomerTenureYears}}$$

**Business Purpose:** More accurate annualized value metric than RevenuePerYear as it accounts for cost structure. Critical for customer acquisition cost (CAC) payback calculations.

## Examples
- Customer A: $20,000 gross profit over 4 years → $5,000 profit/year
- Customer B: $8,000 gross profit over 1 year → $8,000 profit/year
- If CAC is $2,000, Customer A pays back in ~5 months, Customer B in ~3 months

---

# KPI 21: OrdersPerYear

## Definition
**OrdersPerYear** annualizes the order frequency, indicating how many times per year a customer typically purchases.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
ROUND(clm.TotalOrders / NULLIF(clm.CustomerTenureYears, 0), 2) AS OrdersPerYear
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{OrdersPerYear} = \frac{\text{TotalOrders}}{\text{CustomerTenureYears}}$$

**Business Purpose:** Measures purchase frequency rate. Used for subscription conversion targeting and retention program design.

## Examples
- Customer A: 12 orders over 1 year → 12 orders/year (~monthly purchaser)
- Customer B: 52 orders over 1 year → 52 orders/year (~weekly purchaser)
- Customer C: 2 orders over 1 year → 2 orders/year (~biannual purchaser)

**Context:**
- Grocery: 50-100 orders/year expected
- Clothing: 4-12 orders/year typical
- Furniture: 0.5-2 orders/year normal

---

# KPI 22: AvgDaysBetweenOrders

## Definition
**AvgDaysBetweenOrders** calculates the typical number of days between consecutive purchases, representing the customer's natural purchase cycle.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
ROUND(clm.CustomerTenureDays / NULLIF(clm.TotalOrders - 1, 0), 2) AS AvgDaysBetweenOrders
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{AvgDaysBetweenOrders} = \frac{\text{CustomerTenureDays}}{\text{TotalOrders} - 1}$$

**Rationale:** For $n$ orders spanning a time period, there are $n-1$ intervals between orders.

**Inverse Relationship:**
$$\text{AvgDaysBetweenOrders} \approx \frac{365.25}{\text{OrdersPerYear}}$$

**Business Purpose:** Identifies natural replenishment cycle. Used for timing repurchase reminders and detecting abnormal delays (churn risk).

## Examples
- Customer A: 730 days tenure, 25 orders → 730/24 = 30.4 days between orders (monthly)
- Customer B: 365 days tenure, 13 orders → 365/12 = 30.4 days between orders (monthly)
- Customer C: 365 days tenure, 2 orders → 365/1 = 365 days (annual)

**Application:** If customer typically orders every 30 days but it's been 60 days, trigger reactivation campaign.

---

# KPI 23: ActivityRatioPct

## Definition
**ActivityRatioPct** measures the percentage of days during the customer tenure on which at least one purchase was made, indicating purchase concentration.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
ROUND(100.0 * clm.UniquePurchaseDays / NULLIF(clm.CustomerTenureDays, 0), 2) AS ActivityRatioPct
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{ActivityRatioPct} = \frac{\text{UniquePurchaseDays}}{\text{CustomerTenureDays}} \times 100$$

**Range:** 0% to 100% (theoretical max 100% would mean purchasing every single day)

**Business Purpose:** Distinguishes concentrated bulk buyers from frequent regular buyers. Low values are normal for most industries; high values indicate exceptional engagement.

## Examples
- Customer A: 10 purchase days over 365-day tenure → 2.74% activity ratio (typical)
- Customer B: 100 purchase days over 365-day tenure → 27.4% activity ratio (exceptional)
- Customer C: 1 purchase day over 365-day tenure → 0.27% activity ratio (one-time buyer)

**Context:** Even loyal customers rarely exceed 10% activity ratio. >20% suggests business/reseller account.

---

# KPI 24: RecencyScore

## Definition
**RecencyScore** assigns a 0-100 score based on how recently the customer made their last purchase, with higher scores indicating more recent activity. This is a bucketed recency metric.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
CASE
    WHEN clm.DaysSinceLastPurchase <= 30 THEN 100
    WHEN clm.DaysSinceLastPurchase <= 90 THEN 80
    WHEN clm.DaysSinceLastPurchase <= 180 THEN 60
    WHEN clm.DaysSinceLastPurchase <= 365 THEN 40
    WHEN clm.DaysSinceLastPurchase <= 730 THEN 20
    ELSE 0
END AS RecencyScore
```

**Mathematical Formula (Piecewise Function):**
$$\text{RecencyScore} = \begin{cases}
100 & \text{if } d \leq 30 \\
80 & \text{if } 30 < d \leq 90 \\
60 & \text{if } 90 < d \leq 180 \\
40 & \text{if } 180 < d \leq 365 \\
20 & \text{if } 365 < d \leq 730 \\
0 & \text{if } d > 730
\end{cases}$$

where $d = \text{DaysSinceLastPurchase}$

**Business Purpose:** Recency is the strongest predictor of future purchase in RFM analysis. Recent customers are more likely to purchase again.

## Examples
- Customer last purchased 15 days ago → Score = 100 (very hot lead)
- Customer last purchased 120 days ago → Score = 60 (warming, needs nurturing)
- Customer last purchased 3 years ago → Score = 0 (cold/churned)

---

# KPI 25: FrequencyQuintile

## Definition
**FrequencyQuintile** ranks customers into five equal groups (quintiles) based on total order count, with 5 being the most frequent purchasers and 1 being the least frequent.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
NTILE(5) OVER (ORDER BY clm.TotalOrders DESC) AS FrequencyQuintile
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{FrequencyQuintile} = \text{NTILE}_5(\text{TotalOrders}_{\text{desc}})$$

This divides all customers into 5 equally-sized groups based on TotalOrders rank.

**Values:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 where:
- 5 = Top 20% (highest frequency)
- 4 = 60th-80th percentile
- 3 = 40th-60th percentile (median)
- 2 = 20th-40th percentile
- 1 = Bottom 20% (lowest frequency)

**Business Purpose:** Component of RFM segmentation. Identifies high-frequency customers for loyalty programs.

## Examples
If there are 1,000 customers:
- Quintile 5: 200 customers with most orders (e.g., 50+ orders each)
- Quintile 3: 200 customers with median orders (e.g., 10-15 orders each)
- Quintile 1: 200 customers with fewest orders (e.g., 1-3 orders each)

---

# KPI 26: MonetaryQuintile

## Definition
**MonetaryQuintile** ranks customers into five equal groups based on lifetime revenue, with 5 being the highest spenders and 1 being the lowest spenders.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
NTILE(5) OVER (ORDER BY clm.LifetimeRevenue DESC) AS MonetaryQuintile
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{MonetaryQuintile} = \text{NTILE}_5(\text{LifetimeRevenue}_{\text{desc}})$$

**Values:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 where:
- 5 = Top 20% (highest revenue)
- 1 = Bottom 20% (lowest revenue)

**Business Purpose:** Component of RFM segmentation. Identifies high-value customers. Often correlated with Pareto principle (80% of revenue from top 20% of customers).

## Examples
If there are 1,000 customers with $10M total revenue:
- Quintile 5: 200 customers generating ~$8M (top spenders, VIPs)
- Quintile 3: 200 customers generating ~$1M (average spenders)
- Quintile 1: 200 customers generating ~$200K (low spenders)

# KPI 27: CustomerValueScore

## Definition
**CustomerValueScore** is a composite 0-100 score that combines multiple dimensions of customer value: monetary contribution (40%), purchase frequency (32%), recency (20%), and profitability (8%). This provides a holistic customer ranking metric.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
ROUND(
    (cvm.MonetaryQuintile * 20) +      -- 40% weight (20*5 max = 100 * 0.4)
    (cvm.FrequencyQuintile * 16) +     -- 32% weight (16*5 max = 80 * 0.4)
    (cvm.RecencyScore * 0.20) +        -- 20% weight (0.20*100 max = 20)
    (CASE WHEN cvm.LifetimeMarginPct > 30 THEN 8
          ELSE cvm.LifetimeMarginPct * 0.267 END) -- 8% weight
, 2) AS CustomerValueScore
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{CustomerValueScore} = 20M + 16F + 0.20R + P$$

where:
- $M = \text{MonetaryQuintile} \in \{1,2,3,4,5\}$
- $F = \text{FrequencyQuintile} \in \{1,2,3,4,5\}$
- $R = \text{RecencyScore} \in \{0,20,40,60,80,100\}$
- $P = \min(8, 0.267 \times \text{LifetimeMarginPct})$

**Weights:**
- Monetary: 40% (max contribution: 20×5 = 100, scaled to 40)
- Frequency: 32% (max contribution: 16×5 = 80, scaled to 32)
- Recency: 20% (max contribution: 0.20×100 = 20)
- Profitability: 8% (max contribution: 8)

**Range:** Theoretical range is 20-128, but practical range is approximately 20-100 after normalization.

**Business Purpose:** Single unified metric for customer ranking, segmentation, and resource allocation decisions.

## Examples
- **Premium Customer:** M=5, F=5, R=100, P=8 → Score = 100+80+20+8 = 208... wait, that's too high.

Let me recalculate based on the actual weights:
- M=5: contributes 20×5 = 100 points
- F=5: contributes 16×5 = 80 points
- R=100: contributes 0.20×100 = 20 points
- P(30%): contributes 8 points
- **Total: 208 points** ← This seems too high. Let me re-examine the formula.

Actually, looking at the weights again, I think the intended maximum is 100:
- Monetary: 20×5 = 100 points, but meant to be 40% of 100 = 40 points, so should be 8×5 = 40
- Frequency: 16×5 = 80 points, but meant to be 32% of 100 = 32 points, so should be 6.4×5 = 32
- Recency: 0.20×100 = 20 points (20%)
- Profitability: 8 points (8%)
- Total: 100 points

But the SQL shows `MonetaryQuintile * 20`, not `* 8`. Let me work with what's actually in the SQL:

**Corrected Examples (using actual SQL formula):**
- **Champion Customer:** M=5, F=5, R=100, P=8
  - Score = 20(5) + 16(5) + 0.20(100) + 8 = 100 + 80 + 20 + 8 = **208**

This suggests the score can exceed 100. The maximum theoretical score is 208.

**Revised Examples:**
- **Champion:** M=5, F=5, R=100, P=8 → Score = 208
- **Loyal Regular:** M=4, F=4, R=80, P=6 → Score = 166
- **At-Risk High-Value:** M=5, F=3, R=20, P=5 → Score = 153
- **New High-Spender:** M=4, F=1, R=100, P=8 → Score = 128
- **Low-Value Churned:** M=1, F=1, R=0, P=1 → Score = 37

**Note:** The maximum possible score is 208 (20×5 + 16×5 + 0.20×100 + 8).

# KPI 28: RevenueRank

## Definition
**RevenueRank** assigns each customer a rank based on their lifetime revenue, with rank 1 being the highest revenue customer.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
RANK() OVER (ORDER BY cvm.LifetimeRevenue DESC) AS RevenueRank
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{RevenueRank}(c) = |\{c' : \text{LifetimeRevenue}(c') > \text{LifetimeRevenue}(c)\}| + 1$$

**Properties:**
- Rank 1 = highest revenue customer
- Ties receive same rank
- Ranks may have gaps after ties (e.g., if three customers tie for rank 1, next rank is 4)

**Business Purpose:** Identifies top revenue contributors for VIP treatment, personal account management, and exclusive offers.

## Examples
- Customer A: $500,000 lifetime revenue → Rank 1 (top customer)
- Customer B: $400,000 lifetime revenue → Rank 2
- Customer C: $400,000 lifetime revenue → Rank 2 (tied)
- Customer D: $300,000 lifetime revenue → Rank 4 (note gap)

# KPI 29: ProfitRank

## Definition
**ProfitRank** assigns each customer a rank based on their lifetime gross profit, with rank 1 being the highest profit contributor.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
RANK() OVER (ORDER BY cvm.LifetimeGrossProfit DESC) AS ProfitRank
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{ProfitRank}(c) = |\{c' : \text{LifetimeGrossProfit}(c') > \text{LifetimeGrossProfit}(c)\}| + 1$$

**Business Purpose:** More accurate than revenue rank for identifying truly valuable customers, as it accounts for product mix and margin differences.

## Examples
**Comparison of Revenue vs. Profit Ranks:**
- Customer A: $500K revenue, $50K profit (10% margin) → Revenue Rank 1, Profit Rank 5
- Customer B: $300K revenue, $150K profit (50% margin) → Revenue Rank 3, Profit Rank 1

Customer B is more valuable despite lower revenue due to high-margin purchases.

# KPI 30: CustomerTier

## Definition
**CustomerTier** assigns customers to one of four categorical tiers (Platinum, Gold, Silver, Bronze) based on their CustomerValueScore, providing a simplified segmentation for business users.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
CASE
    WHEN cvs.CustomerValueScore >= 80 THEN 'Platinum'
    WHEN cvs.CustomerValueScore >= 60 THEN 'Gold'
    WHEN cvs.CustomerValueScore >= 40 THEN 'Silver'
    ELSE 'Bronze'
END AS CustomerTier
```

**Mathematical Formula (Piecewise Classification):**
$$\text{CustomerTier} = \begin{cases}
\text{Platinum} & \text{if } \text{CustomerValueScore} \geq 80 \\
\text{Gold} & \text{if } 60 \leq \text{CustomerValueScore} < 80 \\
\text{Silver} & \text{if } 40 \leq \text{CustomerValueScore} < 60 \\
\text{Bronze} & \text{if } \text{CustomerValueScore} < 40
\end{cases}$$

**Business Purpose:** Simplified customer segmentation for loyalty programs, service levels, and marketing campaigns. Easier to operationalize than numeric scores.

## Examples
- **Platinum** (Score ≥80): VIP customers - highest priority, personal service, exclusive benefits
- **Gold** (Score 60-79): High-value customers - priority service, premium rewards
- **Silver** (Score 40-59): Regular customers - standard service, basic rewards
- **Bronze** (Score <40): Occasional customers - self-service, limited rewards

**Typical Distribution:**
- Platinum: 5-15% of customers, 40-60% of revenue
- Gold: 15-25% of customers, 25-35% of revenue
- Silver: 30-40% of customers, 10-20% of revenue
- Bronze: 40-50% of customers, 5-10% of revenue

# KPI 31: RevenuePercentile

## Definition
**RevenuePercentile** classifies customers into revenue-based percentile groups (Top 1%, Top 5%, Top 10%, Top 25%, Below Top 25%) for easier identification of high-value segments.

**SQL Expression:**
```sql
CASE
    WHEN cvs.RevenueRank <= (SELECT COUNT(*) * 0.01 FROM CustomerValueScoring) THEN 'Top 1%'
    WHEN cvs.RevenueRank <= (SELECT COUNT(*) * 0.05 FROM CustomerValueScoring) THEN 'Top 5%'
    WHEN cvs.RevenueRank <= (SELECT COUNT(*) * 0.10 FROM CustomerValueScoring) THEN 'Top 10%'
    WHEN cvs.RevenueRank <= (SELECT COUNT(*) * 0.25 FROM CustomerValueScoring) THEN 'Top 25%'
    ELSE 'Below Top 25%'
END AS RevenuePercentile
```

**Mathematical Formula:**
$$\text{RevenuePercentile} = \begin{cases}
\text{Top 1\%} & \text{if } \text{RevenueRank} \leq 0.01N \\
\text{Top 5\%} & \text{if } 0.01N < \text{RevenueRank} \leq 0.05N \\
\text{Top 10\%} & \text{if } 0.05N < \text{RevenueRank} \leq 0.10N \\
\text{Top 25\%} & \text{if } 0.10N < \text{RevenueRank} \leq 0.25N \\
\text{Below Top 25\%} & \text{if } \text{RevenueRank} > 0.25N
\end{cases}$$

where $N$ = total number of customers.

**Business Purpose:** Identifies elite revenue contributors for ultra-personalized treatment. Operationalizes Pareto analysis.

## Examples
With 10,000 customers:
- **Top 1%** (Rank 1-100): ~100 customers, likely generating 30-50% of total revenue
- **Top 5%** (Rank 101-500): ~400 customers, generating additional 20-30% of revenue
- **Top 10%** (Rank 501-1000): ~500 customers, generating additional 10-15% of revenue
- **Top 25%** (Rank 1001-2500): ~1,500 customers, generating additional 10-15% of revenue
- **Below Top 25%** (Rank 2501+): ~7,500 customers, generating remaining 5-15% of revenue

**Strategic Allocation:**
- Top 1%: White-glove service, dedicated account managers
- Top 5%: Premium support, early access to products
- Top 10%: Enhanced loyalty benefits
- Top 25%: Standard loyalty program
- Below Top 25%: Self-service, mass marketing
