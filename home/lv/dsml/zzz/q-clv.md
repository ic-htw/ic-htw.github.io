# Customer Lifetime Value and Lifecycle Analysis

# Introduction

This document presents five complex business intelligence questions focused on customer lifetime value (CLV), lifecycle stage progression, and customer value optimization within the AdventureWorks data warehouse. These analyses examine Internet sales customers through multiple lenses including historical value calculation, predictive value modeling, behavioral segmentation, retention patterns, and growth trajectory analysis.

The queries leverage FactInternetSales transaction history along with customer demographic and behavioral attributes from DimCustomer to calculate comprehensive CLV metrics, identify high-value customer segments, predict churn risk, optimize acquisition and retention investments, and enable data-driven customer relationship management strategies. Advanced SQL techniques including cohort analysis, RFM segmentation, lifecycle modeling, and predictive scoring transform raw transaction data into actionable customer intelligence.

# Business Question 1: Comprehensive Customer Lifetime Value Calculation and Segmentation

## Intent

Calculate comprehensive customer lifetime value metrics including historical CLV, average order value, purchase frequency, customer tenure, and profitability contribution. Segment customers into value tiers (Platinum, Gold, Silver, Bronze) based on multi-dimensional scoring, and compare CLV across customer demographic segments to identify high-value customer profiles for targeted acquisition and retention strategies.

The query calculates:
- Historical CLV (total revenue and profit per customer)
- Purchase behavior metrics (frequency, recency, average order value)
- Customer tenure and relationship duration
- CLV per year and per month ratios
- Multi-factor customer value scoring and tiering
- Demographic profile analysis by value tier

# Business Question 2: RFM Segmentation and Targeted Marketing Strategy

## Intent

Implement comprehensive RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to segment customers into actionable marketing segments. This classic customer segmentation approach identifies Champions, Loyal Customers, At-Risk customers, and Lost customers, enabling targeted retention campaigns, win-back strategies, and loyalty program optimization based on behavioral patterns.

The query calculates:
- RFM scores (1-5 scale for each dimension)
- Combined RFM segments with business labels
- Segment-specific characteristics and profitability
- Recommended marketing actions per segment
- Segment migration opportunities and risks

# Business Question 3: Customer Lifecycle Stage Progression and Maturity Analysis

## Intent

Analyze customer progression through lifecycle stages from acquisition to maturity, identifying stage transition patterns, time-to-value metrics, and stage-specific characteristics. This analysis enables lifecycle marketing optimization, identifies bottlenecks in customer development, and reveals opportunities to accelerate customers through the value curve from new buyers to loyal advocates.

The query calculates:
- Lifecycle stage assignment (New, Developing, Growing, Mature, At-Risk, Churned)
- Stage-specific metrics and behaviors
- Time spent in each stage and progression rates
- Stage transition probabilities and patterns
- Revenue and profitability by lifecycle stage

# Business Question 4: Customer Product Category Affinity and Cross-Sell Opportunity Matrix

## Intent

Analyze customer purchase patterns across product categories to identify category affinity, cross-sell opportunities, and product portfolio expansion potential. This analysis reveals which high-value customers are underpenetrated in specific categories, identifies natural product bundle opportunities, and enables targeted cross-sell campaigns based on demonstrated category preferences and purchase history.

The query calculates:
- Category penetration by customer value tier
- Category affinity and purchase sequence patterns
- Cross-sell opportunity scoring
- Product portfolio completeness index
- Next-best-product recommendations

# Business Question 5: Predictive Customer Churn Risk and Retention Value Prioritization

## Intent

Develop a comprehensive churn risk model that combines behavioral signals, engagement trends, and value metrics to identify customers at risk of churning and prioritize retention investments based on expected value loss. This analysis enables proactive retention campaigns targeted at high-value at-risk customers, optimizes retention spending allocation, and measures the financial impact of potential churn.

The query calculates:
- Multi-factor churn risk scoring (0-100 scale)
- Behavioral churn indicators (recency, declining frequency, engagement trends)
- At-risk customer value quantification
- Retention investment recommendations
- Expected value at risk from churn

# Summary

These five business intelligence questions provide comprehensive insights into customer lifetime value, lifecycle progression, and retention optimization across the AdventureWorks Internet sales channel:

1. **Comprehensive CLV Calculation and Segmentation** - Calculates multi-dimensional customer value metrics with Platinum/Gold/Silver/Bronze tiering based on revenue, frequency, recency, and profitability
2. **RFM Segmentation and Targeted Marketing** - Implements classic RFM analysis to identify Champions, Loyal Customers, At-Risk segments, and Lost customers with actionable marketing recommendations
3. **Customer Lifecycle Stage Progression** - Tracks customers through New, Developing, Growing, Mature, At-Risk, and Churned stages with stage-specific intervention strategies
4. **Product Category Affinity and Cross-Sell Matrix** - Analyzes category penetration and affinity patterns to identify high-value cross-sell opportunities with next-best-product recommendations
5. **Predictive Churn Risk and Retention Prioritization** - Develops multi-factor churn risk scoring (0-100) combining recency, activity decline, and engagement trends with retention investment recommendations

These analyses leverage advanced SQL techniques including cohort analysis, RFM scoring, lifecycle modeling, affinity analysis, and predictive risk scoring to transform transactional data into actionable customer intelligence for acquisition, development, retention, and value maximization strategies.
