*   This evolution reflects a growing demand for tools that are powerful and tailored to specific tasks, such as rapid statistical exploration, interactive web deployment, or creating publication-quality figures.
*   The report classifies prominent libraries into **four core categories** based on their design philosophy and primary use case:
    *   **Foundational** (Matplotlib)
    *   **Statistical** (Seaborn)
    *   **Interactive/Web-based** (Plotly, Bokeh)
    *   **Declarative** (Altair)
*   **Selecting an appropriate library** is a context-dependent decision that balances project goals with user skillset.
*   A modern data professional's toolkit often involves a **hybrid approach**, leveraging different libraries for different stages of the data analysis and communication workflow.

---

### **Slide 3: Matplotlib: The Foundational Layer - Core Philosophy**

*   **Matplotlib** stands as the **enduring cornerstone** of Python data visualization since 2003.
*   **Core Philosophy:** Provides a **low-level, highly customizable, and imperative interface**, giving users **granular control** over every aspect of a plot.
*   Often described as a "low-level plotting library" that makes "easy things easy and hard things possible".
*   **Two Primary APIs:**
    *   **pyplot module:** A command-style function set mimicking MATLAB, ideal for quick, simple plots and interactive sessions in environments like Jupyter Notebooks.
    *   **Object-Oriented (OO) API:** Recommended for complex plots, multiple subplots, and achieving **fine-grained control** over styling and layout, and for serious, long-term development.
*   The pyplot layer's design attracted early users but also created a low-level, sometimes verbose API, leading to the emergence of wrappers like Seaborn.

---

### **Slide 4: Matplotlib: Extensive Capabilities & Use Cases**
